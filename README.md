# TSJS
Truck Simulator Job Searcher (TSJS) is a desktop application that supports more advanced searches compared to the current system used in both Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator. TSJS is written in C# using Visual Studio Community 2015 and works by parsing an unencrypted plain text ``game.sii`` save file.
